# Connect The Words

This is a game to help people studying English or Italian words, to improve their vocabulary.

The english words were taen from The New General Service List (NGSL - https://www.newgeneralservicelist.com/new-general-service-list) and then translated with Google.

The other code was written by me to develope e simple but nice (I hope) way to learn.

There ae 3 different difficulty. Any time the you connect a word with his translations the code will select three new words and it put them one by one in the schema.
The difficulty is that before that it puts them into, it shuffles them, so maybe there aren't all the right connections in the table.
You have only on life.
