# Connect The Words

This is a vocabulary matching game designed to help users learn and improve their English or Italian word knowledge.

The English words are sourced from the New General Service List (NGSL - https://www.newgeneralservicelist.com/new-general-service-list) and translated using Google services.

The game features 3 different difficulty levels.
Any time you connect a word with its correct translation, the matched pair is removed and your score increases. The game then automatically loads three new words and shuffles them into the columns.

The core challenge is that the new words are shuffled before being placed, meaning the table may not always contain a correct, available match.
You have only one life: if you make an incorrect connection, the game ends.
